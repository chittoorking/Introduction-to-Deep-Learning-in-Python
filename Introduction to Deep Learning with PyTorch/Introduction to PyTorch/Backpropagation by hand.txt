Given the computational graph above, we want to calculate the derivatives for the leaf nodes (x, y and z). 
To get you started we already calculated the results of the forward pass (in red) in addition to calculating the derivatives of f and q.

The rules for derivative computations have been given in the table below:











The Derivative of x is 5, the derivative of y is 5, the derivative of z is 1.
