Now you are going to explore a bit the dataloaders you created in the previous exercise.
In particular, you will compute the shape of the dataset in addition to the minibatch size.

Instructions
Find the shapes of the trainset and testset.
Print the computed values.
Find the size of the minibatch for both trainset and testset.
Print the minibatch size.

# Compute the shape of the training set and testing set
trainset_shape = trainloader.dataset.train_data.shape
testset_shape = testloader.dataset.test_data.shape

# Print the computed shapes
print(trainset_shape, testset_shape)

# Compute the size of the minibatch for training set and testing set
trainset_batchsize = trainloader.batch_size
testset_batchsize = testloader.batch_size

# Print sizes of the minibatch
print(trainset_batchsize, testset_batchsize)

output:
torch.Size([60000, 28, 28]) torch.Size([10000, 28, 28])
32 32
