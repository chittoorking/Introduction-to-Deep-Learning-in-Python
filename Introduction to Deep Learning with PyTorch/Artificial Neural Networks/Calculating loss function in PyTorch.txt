You are going to code the previous exercise, and make sure that we computed the loss correctly. 
Predicted scores are -1.2 for class 0 (cat), 0.12 for class 1 (car) and 4.8 for class 2 (frog). 
The ground truth is class 2 (frog). Compute the loss function in PyTorch.

Class	Predicted Score
Cat	-1.2
Car	0.12
Frog	4.8
Instructions
Initialize the tensor of scores with numbers [[-1.2, 0.12, 4.8]], and the tensor of ground truth [2].
Instantiate the cross-entropy loss and call it criterion.
Compute and print the loss.

# Initialize the scores and ground truth
logits = torch.tensor([[-1.2,0.12,4.8]])
ground_truth = torch.tensor([2])

# Instantiate cross entropy loss
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Compute and print the loss
loss = criterion(logits,ground_truth)
print(loss)

output:
tensor(0.0117)
