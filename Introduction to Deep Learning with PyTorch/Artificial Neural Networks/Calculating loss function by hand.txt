Let's start the exercises by calculating the loss function by hand.
Don't do this exercise in PyTorch, it is important to first do it using only pen and paper (and a calculator).

We have the same example as before but now our object is actually a frog, 
and the predicted scores are -1.2 for class 0 (cat), 0.12 for class 1 (car) and 4.8 for class 2 (frog).

What is the result of the softmax cross-entropy loss function?


Class	Predicted Score
Cat	-1.2
Car	0.12
Frog	4.8

output:

0.0117
