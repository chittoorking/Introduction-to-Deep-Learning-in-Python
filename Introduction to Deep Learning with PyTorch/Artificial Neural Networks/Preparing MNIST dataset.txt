You are going to prepare dataloaders for MNIST training and testing set.
As we explained in the lecture, MNIST has some differences to CIFAR-10,
with the main difference being that MNIST images are grayscale (1 channel based) instead of RGB (3 channels).

Instructions
Transform the data to torch tensors and normalize it to have mean is 0.1307 and std is 0.3081.
Prepare the trainset and the testset.
Prepare the dataloaders for training and testing so that only 32 pictures are processed at a time and the training data is shuffled each time.

# Transform the data to torch tensors and normalize it 
transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(),
								transforms.Normalize((0.1307), ((0.3081)))])

# Prepare training set and testing set
trainset = torchvision.datasets.MNIST('mnist', train=True, 
									  download=True, transform=transform)
testset = torchvision.datasets.MNIST('mnist', train=False,
			   download=True, transform=transform)

# Prepare training loader and testing loader
trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=32,
                                          shuffle=True, num_workers=0)
testloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(testset, batch_size=32,
										 shuffle=False, num_workers=0)
