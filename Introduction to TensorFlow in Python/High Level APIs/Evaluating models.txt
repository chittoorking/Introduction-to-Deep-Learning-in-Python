Two models have been trained and are available: large_model, which has many parameters; and small_model, which has fewer parameters. 
Both models have been trained using train_features and train_labels, which are available to you.
A separate test set, which consists of test_features and test_labels, is also available.

Your goal is to evaluate relative model performance and also determine whether either model exhibits signs of overfitting.
You will do this by evaluating large_model and small_model on both the train and test sets. 
For each model, you can do this by applying the .evaluate(x, y) method to compute the loss for features x and labels y. 
You will then compare the four losses generated.

Instructions
Evaluate the small model using the train data.
Evaluate the small model using the test data.
Evaluate the large model using the train data.
Evaluate the large model using the test data.

# Evaluate the small model using the train data
small_train = small_model.evaluate(train_features, train_labels)

# Evaluate the small model using the test data
small_test = small_model.evaluate(test_features,test_labels)

# Evaluate the large model using the train data
large_train = large_model.evaluate(train_features, train_labels)

# Evaluate the large model using the test data
large_test = large_model.evaluate(test_features,test_labels)

# Print losses
print('\n Small - Train: {}, Test: {}'.format(small_train, small_test))
print('Large - Train: {}, Test: {}'.format(large_train, large_test))

Note:
Notice that the gap between the test and train set losses is high for large_model, suggesting that overfitting may be an issue. 
Furthermore, both test and train set performance is better for large_model. 
This suggests that we may want to use large_model, but reduce the number of training epochs.
