Unlike a constant, a variable's value can be modified. This will be useful when we want to train a model by updating its parameters.

Let's try defining and printing a variable. We'll then convert the variable to a numpy array, print again, and check for differences.
Note that Variable(), which is used to create a variable tensor, has been imported from tensorflow and is available to use in the exercise.

Instructions
Define a variable, A1, as the 1-dimensional tensor: [1, 2, 3, 4].
Apply .numpy() to A1 and assign it to B1.

# Define the 1-dimensional variable A1
A1 = Variable([1, 2, 3, 4])

# Print the variable A1
print('\n A1: ', A1)

# Convert A1 to a numpy array and assign it to B1
B1 = A1.numpy()

# Print B1
print('\n B1: ', B1)

A1:  <tf.Variable 'Variable:0' shape=(4,) dtype=int32, numpy=array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype=int32)>

 B1:  [1 2 3 4]
